Our solution, ResQLink, is an AI-powered disaster relief coordination platform that connects victims, volunteers, NGOs, and resources in real-time. It provides:
(1)AI-driven request matching (automatically connects victims to the nearest available help).
(2)Live disaster mapping (tracks affected areas and available aid).
(3)Multi-channel communication (works via app, web, and SMS for low-connectivity regions).
(4)Crowdsourced crisis reports with AI verification (ensures accurate data).
(5)Offline support & automated notifications (SMS alerts for remote areas).
(6)This platform optimizes emergency response, making disaster relief faster, smarter, and more efficient.
